# tenzies

This a game of tenzies built with React.

You roll the dice(of 10 different die) until you've picked all same die at which point you get a confetti for your win!

There's a function that tracks the number of rolls it took for a player to finally win.

There's also a tracker for the time it took a player to win.

The best time is stored in storage(using local storage) and each time you beat your best time, you get a confetti and congratulatory message.
